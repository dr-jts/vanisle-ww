<ul>
<li><b>S-Bend</b> - A chute/pool/ledges combo.  Easiest line is L.
Centre line is slightly more exciting due to rocks and/or diagonal wave.
Grab the eddy on the L for one of the nicest surf waves on the river
when the level is right.
The wave at the bottom of the drop is good for playing at all levels.

<li><b>Bernie's Negligee</b> - a large hole at most levels.
Watch out for the rock in the hole when surfing.
Best line to avoid the hole is to stay hard right.
At lower levels it can be sneaked on the left.
(The story is that this was so named "because it is so full of holes".
But who Bernie was and why his undergarment was so excessively perforated
is lost to history.)

<li><b>Jet Ferry</b> - a narrowing of the river with a high cliff on the R.
Swirly eddies with a strong jet ferry at the right level.

<li><b>Squirt City</b> - an excellent spot for getting vertical,
on the L in the middle of a calm pool

<li><b>Double Whammy</b> - a staircase rapid leads to the <b>Waiting Room</b>,
an eddy on the R above a chute.
At the bottom of the chute
is the <b>Five Fingers of Death</b> - avoid their clutches by staying L.

<li><b>Last Drop</b> - biggest drop on the run.
Short, but steep and rocky.
Often avoided by pulling out immediately above.
Usually run L - but avoid the sharp rocks on the far left.
Boof the drop to avoid getting squirted.
Can be sneaked via a chute in the centre.
R line is risky due to a narrow chute, holes and undercuts.

This is the most popular run on the southern island due to its ease of access, long season,
and friendly water.
Suitable for all abilities, and has places to play all season long.

A popular canoe run.  A bit mellow for most kayakers.
Stoltz to Vimy is a good winter day's run.
Vimy to Duncan is about the same length, but a wee bit mellower.
Lake to Bay is the classic canoe run, which can be done
in one long day or two enjoyable ones.
